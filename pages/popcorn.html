        <span id="popcorn-link-color">Popcorn</span> is a cine-oriented online service that operates via mobile apps. The platform is primarily used to book movie tickets, share reviews and thoughts toward the movies. Popcorn is born to fill in the gap in the movie based online service industry which offers movie ticket booking, online payment and communication.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">Challenges:</p>
      <ul class="listing">
        <li>Eliminate the barrier between online ticket booking and social media platform</li>
        <li>Create a cohesive user interface for both familiar and unfamiliar users</li>
        <li>Provide a seamless and linear booking experience</li>
        <li>Provide an engaging and helpful social media platform</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="heading">Understanding the users</p>
      <p class="paragraph">To kickoff, I found qualitative research methods consisting of competitive analysis, user interviews, and persona hypothesis construction. All the methods are to answer some initial key questions:</p>
      <ul class="listing">
        <li>What are the pain points the product trying to solve?</li>
        <li>Who do we see as my competitors?</li>
        <li>How are users reaching their goals by using the product?</li>
        <li>Where is the user when they’re using the product?</li>
        <li>Why is the problem important?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subheading">Meet the users</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subheading">Competitive analysis</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The purpose of conducting the competitive audit to compare the ticket purchasing experience of each competitor’s app as a new user and a returning user. I put on the table both direct and indirect competitors to see the opportunity of Popcorn to be a one-stop app for the users.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The major features between competitors are similar (they are all used to book movie tickets), however the noticeable differences were:</p>
      <ul class="listing">
        <li>Complicated vs simplified booking process</li>
        <li>Inconsistent and confusing vs simple and sophisticated interface</li>
        <li>Specialization of Products</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="subheading">User journey</p>
      <p class="paragraph">I conducted a basic user flow that would smoothly goes from start to finish. This way helps us to understand how users interact with the product and navigate through the app.</p>
      <img src="../images/popcorn/popcorn-user-journey.png" class="body-image">
      <p class="subheading">Wireframe</p>
      <p class="paragraph">After building the main user flow, I started designing the wireframe. This process is the preparation for the usability testing to review what the pros and cons and what need to be improved.</p>

      <p class="subheading">Usability testing</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The usability testing was conducted to figure out what specific difficulties users encounter when they try to complete the core tasks of the Popcorn app: item selection, booking tickets, and in-app navigation.</p>

          <p class="subheading">Getting started</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The "Getting started" was created to be as simple as possible. "Register" and "Sign in" were combined to be familiar with new and returning users. By inputting their phone numbers and email addresses, users would be sent codes to get into the app. If this is the first time, users had to go through a small setting up process. No password needed.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">If the actual cinema locations have posters, standee, or any product placement, Popcorn would like to introduce Stories. Stories were created to promote movies by showing their posters, behind-the-scenes, press interview, etc. This benefits the user experience by adding more promotional content in the app.</p>

      <p class="subheading">Impact</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Although <span id="popcorn-link-color">Popcorn</span> is a concept project, you can view the app prototype by clicking here. <span id="popcorn-link-color">Popcorn</span> was created to narrow the gap between purchasing and communicating in the movie industry. By putting the related features in a one-stop app, <span id="popcorn-link-color">Popcorn</span> would be a potential and competitive product in the market.</p>
      <div class="going-forward-divider"></div>
      <p class="subheading">What I learned</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This project is a chance for me to keep practicing and improving my design and research skills as a product designer. Besides, this is a very fascinating and challenging concept for my creativity. I realized that a product's success is primarily determined by the users' insights, not just the polished and appealing aesthetic.</p>
      <div class="going-forward-divider"></div>
      <p class="subheading">Next steps</p>
      <p class="paragraph">There is a lot of things more to do in my mind. The most important features to mention are dark mode, more language options, contribution rewards, and a website version.</p>
