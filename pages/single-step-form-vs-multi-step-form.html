        Data is very important. And, collecting data is important, too. So how to collect the most relevant information from our users while keeping them engaged.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Web forms are the choice. They are very useful tools for collecting data from our customers. So what is the best practice of using forms? The very two common types of forms are single-step forms and multi-step forms.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        In this article, we will put single-step forms and multi-step forms side by side on what are they and how to use them.

      <p class="heading">Single-step forms</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Single-step forms are the first to be born with all the questions put together in one place. This traditional feature makes single-step form annoying for users. No one wants to be bothered by tons of queries, especially a long format single-step form.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Using long forms with a lot of questions on websites is no longer efficient when customers pay more attention to sharing information online these days than in the past. Oh, they are also lazy. So is it hard to attract users’ attention in a single-step form?</p>

    <div class="body-section">
      <p class="heading">How to use Single-step forms?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">To make customers feel more comfortable and effortless when filling in single-step forms, the forms must go straight to the point, cut down the questions and only focus on what applies to the customers. This insight makes the forms look less stressed and more user-friendly. As a result, it helps increase the conversion rates.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Another way to help the forms look more user-centric is to let them skip the form. No, it is not a crazy idea. To let them skip is to let them stay. A skippable pop-up form creates a sense of urgency for customers about “What I gonna miss?” as well as a regretted skip.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Back in 2011, when <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" class="blog-link-color">a small experiment</a> was conducted on how questions reduction helps increase conversion rates. It showed that when the questions are reduced from 9 to 5 helps increase conversion rates by 13.4%. Even today, cutting a question in a form is an effective way to increase conversion rates.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">So single-step forms perform best for collecting basic information (contact forms and subscription forms are the best use cases). Just keeping the forms brief and focused is the key to pulling the customers in our direction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-section">
      <p class="heading">Multi-step forms</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Unlike their older brothers, multi-step forms are a renovation. Multi-step forms not only divide questions into separate pages but grouping the relevant questions into one place.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Multi-step forms are very effective tools in customer engagement by grouping the relevant questions. They also help the customers feel more relaxing when filling in the forms without being overwhelmed by tons of questions.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">An example of successfully using multi-step forms is the sign-up process of Duolingo. They know how to motivate customers by helping them divide the questions into separate pages and track the process by putting a process bar on top.</p>

    <div class="body-section">
      <p class="heading">How to use them?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Multi-step forms are very dynamic. This feature allows them to be the best practice in almost all situations in B2B and B2C. Of course, they are used most in any marketing campaign. A fun, dynamic multi-step pop-up form is a very interesting way to attract customers, as well as improve the user experience.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Features that make multi-step forms stand out:</p>
      <ul class="listing">
        <li>They increase the conversion rates</li>
        <li>They group the relevant information together</li>
        <li>They are user-centric</li>
        <li>They are better for UX</li>
        <li>They are the best for almost all the use cases</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="body-section">
      <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Single-step forms and multi-step forms are together ways to help collect customers’ insights. Although multi-step forms are more dynamic and useful in most cases, single-step forms are effective in certain situations. Eventually, forms are just tools. It is not about which one to use; it is about how to use each one best.</p>
